.NET Bio: Readme.txt
Version 1.01, March 2012 

.NET Bio is an open source, reusable .NET library and application programming interface (API) for bioinformatics research.

.NET Bio is available at http://bio.codeplex.com. It is licensed under the OSI approved Apache 2.0 License, which may be found here: http://bio.codeplex.com/license. 

KNOWN ISSUES
============
- Current issues are listed here: http://bio.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced

- We currently have a single sequence limit of 2GB in length. This is not a data size limit for the assembly process. So any single RNA, DNA, or protein sequence in .NET Bio is limited to 2 billion characters. The largest human chromosome is 250MB so the single sequence limit should NOT be a limiting factor in your development. If you experiences issues related with this limit please post on the issue tracker tab on the Codeplex site.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.0 TO VERSION 1.01
========================================

Breaking Changes

- .NET Bio no longer autodetects the FASTQ file subtypes. This is due to a change in quality scoring in the Illumina file format. Version 1.5 and 1.8 are now indistinguishable and as such we have changed the auto detect to no longer assume FASTQ. The result is that we do correctly parse V1.5 and V1.8 quality scores on Illumina generated data.

- The ISequenceRangeParser has renamed the FileTypes property to SupportedFileTypes for the interface and single implementation (BedParser). 

- ISequenceRangeParser now derives from IParser for conformity.

- The RegisteredAddIn.GetAlphabets() method has been removed. The functionality was moved to a private method on the Alphabets class. You should just use Alphabets.All to retrieve the list of custom alphabets 

- The BioExcel add-in imports data to worksheets differently. If you depend on the order of rows + cells, you will need to adjust your scripts.

Non-breaking changes

- .NET Bio now supports the SFF (Standard Flowgram Format) in support of sequences generated by the Roche 454 sequencer.

- The Bio.Hpc.Distributeapp.exe has been renamed to be DistributeApp.exe

- The FileFormatConverter.exe is now installed into the Tools directory

- Several new extension methods have been added to Bio.dll
   	ISequence.ConvertToString
   	IAlphabet.CheckIsTermination(byte/char)
	IAlphabet.CheckIsGap(char)
	IAlphabet.CheckIsAmbiguous(char)
	IAlphabet.GetFriendlyName(char)

- SAMBAM parser and formatter have been updated to support new CIGAR and additional optional fields according to specification 1.4.
